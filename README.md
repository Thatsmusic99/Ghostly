### Ghostly
The repository for the Minecraft mod Ghostly. Made so that people can submit issues (includes suggestion issues) - and, of course, pull requests if they change something.

### Releases
Releases are available on CurseForge. Link: https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ghostly

### Builds from GitHub
If you're a modder (another name for a mod developer) you can grab the files from this repository, stick them in your workspace directory, run your setup tasks, and you should be good to go. No idea why errors would occur, but it's possible, unfortunately.
